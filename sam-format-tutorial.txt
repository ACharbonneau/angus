Understading the SAM format
===========================

Log into your instance, create a new directory, navigate to that directory::

	mkdir sam
	cd sam

	# Get the makefile.
	wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ngs-docs/angus/2014/files/Makefile-samtools -O Makefile

A series of exercises will show what the SAM format is and how it changes when
the query sequence is altered and how that reflects in the output.

Also here is a one liner to generate a bamfile:

	# One line bamfile generation.
	bwa mem index/sc.fa query.fa | samtools view -bS - | samtools sort - query
