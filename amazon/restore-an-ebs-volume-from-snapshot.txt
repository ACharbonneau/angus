Restoring an Amazon EBS Volume from a Snapshot
=====================================

Now you have the Amazon EBS Volume to store the data for your instance to use.

they can use the data on the EC2 instance they created.
want to share the EBS Volume with your data to If you want to save your data across instances -- that is, if you want
to have persistent data -- Amazon can do that for you, too.  You can use
the Amazon Elastic Block Storage(EBS) service, which creates a virtual
hard drive that you can (virtually) attach to your EC2 instance.

Note that EBS charges you based partly on how much disk space you use
per month, rather than on connectivity or anything else, so even if
you don't have an EC2 machine running, you'll be paying Amazon for
data storage.
