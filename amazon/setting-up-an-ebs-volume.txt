Storing data persistently with Amazon EBS Volumes
=====================================

If you want to save your data across instances -- that is, if you want
to have persistent data -- Amazon can do that for you, too.  You can use
the Amazon Elastic Block Storage(EBS) service, which creates a virtual
hard drive that you can (virtually) attach to your EC2 instance.

Note that EBS charges you based partly on how much disk space you use
per month, rather than on connectivity or anything else, so even if
you don't have an EC2 machine running, you'll be paying Amazon for
data storage.

You can read more about EBS `here <http://aws.amazon.com/ebs/>`__.

Prerequisites
-------------

This tutorial assumes you've already set up an account on Amazon Web
Services, and that you've completed the EC2 tutorial to set up an
Amazon instances.

Creating an Amazon EBS Volume
---------------------------------------------------------------

Firstly open the Amazon EC2 console at 'https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2>'
 and make sure it says North Virginia in the upper right.

At the AWS Management Console, on the left menu bar, click "Volumes".

Click "Create Volume".

Enter the desired size, and select the zone in which your instance is
running. The volume and instance must be in the same zone. Otherwise,
the volume cannot be attached to your instance.

Then click "Create".

Wait for your volume to finish being created, then click "Attach Volume".

Select the desired running instance. You may leave the Device at the
default: /dev/sdf. This is the name that your EC2 instance can use to
connect to the disk space 

Click "Attach".

When attachment is complete, connect to your instances via SSH.

If the volume is newly created, you must format the volume.
**WARNING: ONLY DO THIS ONCE, WHEN YOU FIRST CREATE THE VOLUME. OTHERWISE, YOU WILL LOSE ALL YOUR
DATA**.
::

  ubuntu@ip-10-31-232-122:~$ sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdf

It will ask you if you want to use the entire device -- say "y" for "yes.

Then, mount the volume. You'll do this every time you attach the volume to an instance::

  ubuntu@ip-10-31-232-122:~$ sudo mkdir /data
  ubuntu@ip-10-31-232-122:~$ sudo mount /dev/xvdf /data

Your drive is now ready to use -- it will be available under /mnt/ebs.

Shutting down your instance
---------------------------

Any volumes you have attached will automatically detach when you shut
down the instance.  You can also stop all processes that are using the
volume, change out of the directory, and type ::

  ubuntu@ip-10-31-232-122:~$ sudo umount -d /dev/xvdf

and then detach the volume via the AWS Web site.
