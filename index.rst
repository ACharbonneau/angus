Welcome to labibi's documentation!

Labibi is a base package to use for documentation and Web sites for
other projects of mine.

For now, I've made it fairly easy to enable Google Analytics, Disqus
commenting, and direct links to edit source files on github.

This is directly based off of Mikko Ohtamaa's excellent work on `the
Plone documentation
<http://opensourcehacker.com/2012/01/08/readthedocs-org-github-edit-backlink-and-short-history-of-plone-documentation/>`__.
